<p><strong>Prepared Exclusively for CertTrackPro</strong></p>
<p><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>
<p>This report examines the challenges HR departments face in managing employee certifications and mandatory training.

<p><strong>Problem Definition</strong></p>
<p>Managing employee certifications and mandatory training is a multifaceted challenge for HR departments.  Current methods are often inefficient, fragmented, and prone to errors, leading to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Fragmentation:</strong>  Scattered records hinder a holistic view of employee skills and compliance status. </li>
